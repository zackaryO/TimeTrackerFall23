## Time Tracker 23 Hand-Off Document
This is a pure Angular version of Weber State's TimeTracker App. Currently supports user registration and basic clock-in/clock-out.

## Startup Instructions
For first time startup, navigate to the directory containing the docker-compose.yml (this should be the root) and run the following command:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
For any subsequent startups, run
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
The -d parameter will remove trailing logs, so omit it if you'd like logs to appear in the console. Only run with --build if you make changes to the package.json or config files on either project.
#### Note: The database will self build when the project is first created using the seed.js

## Configuring Node/Angular Servers Using Docker

### Steps for Package/Docker Image Installation:
1. **Clone the repository.**
2. **Install SQLite, NodeJS, and Docker; enable WSL2 on your system. Restart your computer post-installation.**
   - Note: For SQLite, install both versions with “win32” in their name.
3. **Ensure Docker Desktop is running.**
4. **Navigate to the directory with `docker-compose.yml` and run `docker-compose up --build`.**
5. **Wait for installation completion.** The process is complete when you see “Compiled successfully.”
6. **Verify servers running:** Access `https://localhost:4200` for the front end and `https://localhost:8080` for the back end.
7. **To remove Docker containers:** Run `docker-compose down`.

### Starting/Stopping NodeJS and Angular Servers:
#### Using Docker Desktop
- Go to the Containers tab. Find the container named “timetrackerv2” and use the Play/Stop symbol.

#### Using Terminal
- Ensure Docker Desktop is running.
- Navigate to `Root_of_the_repository\TimeTrackerV2\`.
  - To start servers: Run `docker-compose up -d` or `docker-compose up`.
  - To stop servers: Run `docker-compose stop` or use “Ctrl + C”.

### Alternate Installation and Startup Method (Local Hardware):
#### Using Windows PowerShell
1. **Change execution policy to “RemoteSigned”.**
   - Check current settings with `Get-ExecutionPolicy -List`.
   - Set policy using `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine` or `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`.
2. **Navigate to repository directory `Root_of_the_repository\TimeTracker23\TimeTrackerV2`.**
3. **Install packages:** Run `.\Install_Packages.ps1`.
4. **Start the server:** Run `.\Start_Servers.ps1`.

## Configuring PC for HTTPS Connections
- Certificates are valid from 11/3/2023 to 11/2/2024. Install OpenSSL if needed to generate new certificates.
- **Method 1**: Visit `https://localhost:8080` and `https://localhost:4200`, click “Advanced” then “Proceed to localhost (unsafe)”.
- **Method 2**: Install certificates manually located at `Root_of_the_repository\TimeTrackerV2\NodeAPI\certificates\cert.crt` and `Root_of_the_repository\TimeTrackerV2\Angular\certificates\cert.crt`.
  - For detailed installation steps, refer to the document.
